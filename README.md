This application is a student challenge. The following is the prompt along with user and developer stories. The student will made edits to this README to keep track of edits and additions.


# The API Stories

The Forest Service is considering a proposal to place in conservancy a forest of virgin Douglas fir just outside of Portland, Oregon. Before they give the go-ahead, they need to do an environmental impact study. They've asked you to build an API the rangers can use to report wildlife sightings.

- [x] Story: As a developer I can create an animal model in the database. An animal has the following information: *common name*, *latin name*, *kingdom* (mammal, insect, etc.).

- [x] Story: As the consumer of the API I can **see all the animals** in the database.
    > Hint: Make a few animals using Rails Console

- [IN PROGRESS] Story: As the consumer of the API I can **update an animal** in the database.

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API I can **destroy an animal** in the database.

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API I can **create a new animal** in the database.

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API I can **create a sighting** of an animal with *date* (use the datetime datatype), a *latitude*, and a *longitude*.
    > Hint: An animal has_many sightings. (rails g resource Sighting animal_id:integer ...)
    
    > Hint: Datetime is written in Rails as “year-month-day hr:min:sec" (“2022-01-28 05:40:30") using 24-hr time

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API I can update an **animal sighting** in the database.

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API I can **destroy an animal sighting** in the database.

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API, when I view a specific animal, I *can also see* a list sightings of that animal.
    > Hint: Checkout the Ruby on Rails API docs on how to include associations.

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API, I can run a report to *list all sightings* during a given time period.
    > Hint: Your controller can look like this:
```
class SightingsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    sightings = Sighting.where(date: params[:start_date]..params[:end_date])
    render json: sightings
  end
end
```

    > Remember to add the start_date and end_date to what is permitted in your strong parameters method. In Postman, you will want to utilize the params section to get the correct data. Also see Routes with Params .

## Stretch Challenges
> Note: All of these stories should include the proper RSpec tests. Validations will require specs in spec/models, and the controller method will require specs in spec/requests.

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API, I want to see validation errors if a sighting doesn't include: latitude, longitude, or a date.

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API, I want to see validation errors if an animal doesn't include a common name, or a latin name.

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API, I want to see a validation error if the animals latin name matches exactly the common name.

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API, I want to see a validation error if the animals latin name or common name are not unique.

- [] Story: As the consumer, I want to see a status code of 422 when a post request can not be completed because of validation errors.

##Super Stretch Challenge

- [] Story: As the consumer of the API, I can submit sighting data along with a new animal in a single API call.
    > Hint: Look into `accepts_nested_attributes_for`
